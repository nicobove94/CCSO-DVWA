TODO:
For dvwaPage.inc.php:
The bulk of the work here has already been done.
  1. Consider removing some of the unnecessary vulnerabilities in this file
  2. Make sure the variables in here line up with variables in other files

For dvaPhpIds.inc.php:
Same as above, most of the work has been done. Some thoughts
  1. Scan it again just to be sure

For Parsedown.php:
This file is huge, a little over 1,000 lines. It will definitely take some time to go through this to identify necessary changes (if any).
