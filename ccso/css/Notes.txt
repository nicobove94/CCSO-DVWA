Necessary CSS Changes:
- Change the occurences of green to blue. The color scheme is generally green, black and white, so replacing green with blue gives 
us Penn State colors.
- The favicons should be changed to the CCSO logo. The Nittany Lion is also a valid option.
- Visual Studio Code is giving some error warnings on some lines (marked in the code). These are marked with comments. It is possible
that this is just an issue with the editor, but they should be investigated regardless.
