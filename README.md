# THE COMPETITIVE CYBER SECURITY ORGANIZATION DAMN VULNERABLE WEB APPLICATION

The Pennsylvania State University CCSO DVWA is a fork of digininja's Damn Vulnerable Web application intended for the use by the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition Team. It is designed for use in a CTF environment to practice basic web exploits.
NOTE: This application was originally created by digininja. While we did make many aesthetic and functional changes to it, we are not the original creators of the DVWA. All credit goes to Robin Wood and any other creators/contributors to the DVWA.
