CCSO README

This project is a fork of digininja's DVWA that is specifically tailored to the needs of the Pennsylvania State University Competitive Cyber Security Organization's Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition team. It is intended to be used in lab settings for the improvement of basic pentesting skills.

NOTE: I did not create the DVWA. This is merely an edited version of the original. All credit is due to the original creators of the Damn Vulnerable Web Application.
